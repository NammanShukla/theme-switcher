## A Very Cool Theme Switcher

Using React's [Context API ](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html), Although the documentation was old; I was still able to get something out of them along with the new [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) documentation. 

This app highlights the usage and provides a dark theme and a light theme toggle.
